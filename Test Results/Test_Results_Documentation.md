## 2. Error Analysis  
When performing the tests outlined in the test plan, none of the tests failed within any of the environments they were tested in. As far as testing goes, this application performed incredibly well. The closest issue to a defect was that when the grid is resized to the largest dimensions allowed, it is a little slow when drawing the 100 x 100 grid. Although slightly irritating to wait for, this does NOT in any way effect the application negatively or cause any issues.
